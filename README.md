# Data Cleaning and RFM Metrics Calculation ðŸ§¹ðŸ“Š

## Context

A leading e-commerce company has enlisted your expertise to analyze customer recency, frequency, and monetary metrics (RFM). Specifically:

- **Recency (R):** The time since the customer's last purchase (in days)
- **Frequency (F):** The number of purchases made by the customer
- **Monetary (M):** The average ticket amount spent by the customer, where the average is calculated based on the total spent per order for each customer.

To accomplish this task, you have received a dataset in CSV format. Your mission is to develop a Python code that processes this dataset and generates an output CSV file containing customer identifiers and their corresponding RFM metrics.

## About the Data

The dataset comprises purchase information from an e-commerce platform across 37 countries. It includes customer identification and purchase details.

| Column       | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| CustomerID   | Customer identification code       |
| Description  | Product description                |
| InvoiceNo    | Invoice code                       |
| StockCode    | Product stock code                 |
| Quantity     | Quantity of the product            |
| InvoiceDate  | Purchase invoice date              |
| UnitPrice    | Unit price of the product          |
| Country      | Country of purchase                |
